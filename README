HTML-TableExtract
-----------------

HTML::TableExtract is a module that simplifies the extraction of
information contained in tables within HTML documents.

Tables of note may be specified using Headers, Depth, Count,
Attributes, or some combination of the three. See the module
documentation for details.


INSTALLATION

You install HTML-TableExtract, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DOCUMENTATION

See HTML/TableExtract.pm for the code. See Changes for recent changes.
POD style documentation is included in the module. This is normally
converted to a manual page and installed as part of the "make install"
process. You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract
and read documentation from the module directly.
