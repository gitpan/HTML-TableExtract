HTML-TableExtract
-----------------

HTML::TableExtract is a module that simplifies the extraction
of information contained in tables within HTML documents.

Tables of note may be specified using Headers, Depth, Count,
or some combination of the three. See the module documentation
for details.

INSTALLATION

You install HTML-TableExtract, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

See HTML/TableExtract.pm for the code. See Changes for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in the module.
This is normally converted to a manual page and installed as part
of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use
the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read documentation from the
module directly.
